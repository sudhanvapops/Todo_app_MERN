# 📌 MERN Stack Todo App

A simple yet functional Todo app built using the MERN stack with improvements over the original course implementation.

## 🚀 About This Project
This project is an improved version of the Todo app taught in **Hitesh Choudhary Sir's** MERN stack course on Udemy. The course initially implemented the app using **React** and **Local Storage** for data persistence. I enhanced it by integrating **MongoDB** as the database and implementing a proper **Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture**.

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **React** - Frontend framework
- **MongoDB** - Database for persistent storage
- **Express.js** - Backend framework
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Postman** - API testing tool

---

## 📈 Features & Improvements
✅ Full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) with MongoDB instead of local storage  
✅ Applied **MVC architecture** for cleaner and modular code  
✅ Implemented more than what was taught in the course  
✅ Learned and improved practical MERN stack skills  

---

## 🔍 Areas for Improvement
❌ UI is **not mobile-friendly**  
❌ **Simple UI** (could be more stylish and interactive)  
❌ After every CRUD operation, **fetching all documents from DB again** instead of optimizing state updates  

---

## ⚠️ Cautions & Setup

1. The project uses **local MongoDB host** – make sure MongoDB is running locally.
2. Install dependencies using:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. **Missing `.env` file** – Add your environment variables before running the project.

## 📚 What I Learned
✅ Implementing **MongoDB for persistence** instead of local storage  
✅ **MVC architecture** for better code structure  
✅ Working with **Postman** to test API endpoints  
✅ Improved understanding of **full-stack development** beyond the course material

## 📌 Conclusion
This project helped me solidify my **MERN stack** skills and build a more structured full-stack application. There's still room for improvements, but this was a great learning experience! 🎯
